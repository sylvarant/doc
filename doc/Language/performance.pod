=TITLE Performance

=SUBTITLE Measuring and improving run-time or compile-time performance

B<Make sure you're not wasting time on the wrong code>: start by identifying your
L<"critical 3%"|https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth> by profiling your code (explained on this page).

If you decide to talk about a performance problem, please first prepare a one-liner and/or public gist
that illustrates the problem.
Also, let folk know if you are using Perl 6 in your $dayjob or exploring it for fun
and think about what the minimum speed increase (or ram reduction or whatever) you want/need would be.
What if it took a month for folk to help you achieve that? A year?

=head1 Identifying the problem

=head2 C<now - INIT now>

Expressions of the form C<now - BEGIN now>, where C<BEGIN> is a
L<phase in the running of a Perl 6 program|/language/phasers>, provide a great idiom for timing code snippets.

Using the C<m: your code goes here> L<#perl6 channel evalbot|http://doc.perl6.org/language/glossary#camelia>
you can write lines like:

    m: say now - INIT now 
    rakudo-moar 8bd7ee: OUTPUT«0.0018558␤» 

The C<now> to the left of C<INIT> runs 0.0018558 seconds I<later> than the C<now> to the right of the C<INIT>
because the latter occurs during L<the INIT phase|/language/phasers#INIT>.

=head2 C<prof-m: your code goes here>

Entering C<prof-m: your code goes here> in the L<#perl6 channel|http://doc.perl6.org/language/glossary#IRC>
invokes an evalbot that runs a Perl 6 compiler with a C<--profile> option.
The evalbot's output includes a link to L<profile info|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)>:

    yournick prof-m: say 'hello world' 
    camelia  prof-m 273e89: OUTPUT«hello world␤...» 
             .. Prof: L<http://p.p6c.org/20f9e25>

Click on the profile info link to see a profile for C<say 'hello world'>.

To learn how to interpret profile info, ask questions on channel.

=head2 Profiling locally

When using the L<MoarVM|http://moarvm.org> backend the L<Rakudo|http://rakudo.org> compiler's C<--profile>
command line option writes profile information as an HTML file.

To learn how to interpret the profile info, use the C<prof-m: your code goes here> evalbot (explained
above) and ask questions on channel.

=head2 Profiling compilation

The Rakudo compiler's C<--profile-compile> option profiles the time and memory used to compile code.

=head2 Benchmarks

Use L<perl6-bench|https://github.com/japhb/perl6-bench>.

If you run perl6-bench for multiple compilers (typically versions of Perl 5, Perl 6, or NQP)
then results for each are visually overlaid on the same graphs to provide for quick and easy comparison.

=head1 Improving code 

This bears repeating: B<make sure you're not wasting time on the wrong code>. Start by identifying your
L<"critical 3%"|https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth> via profiling, as discussed in several sections above.

=head2 Line by line

A quick and fun way to try improve code line-by-line is to collaborate with others using the
L<#perl6|http://doc.perl6.org/language/glossary#IRC> evalbot L<camelia|http://doc.perl6.org/language/glossary#camelia>.

=head2 Routine by routine

With multidispatch you can drop in new variants of routines "alongside" existing ones:
 
    # existing code generically matches a two arg foo call:
    multi sub foo (Any $a, Any $b) { ... }
    
    # new variant takes over for a foo("quux", 42) call:
    multi sub foo ("quux", Int $b) { ... }
    
The call overhead of having multiple C<foo> definitions is generally insignificant (though see discussion
of C<where> below), so if your new definition handles its particular case more quickly/leanly than the
previously existing set of definitions then you probably just made your code that much faster/leaner for that case.

=head2 Type-checks and call resolution

Most L<C<where> clauses|/type/Signature#Type_Constraints> -- and thus most
L<subtypes|http://design.perl6.org/S12.html#Types_and_Subtypes>) -- force dynamic (run-time)
type checking and call resolution. This is slower, or at least later, than compile-time.

Method calls are generally resolved as late as possible, so dynamically, at run-time,
whereas sub calls are resolvable statically, at compile-time.

=head2 Choosing better algorithms

Improving L<algorithmic efficiency|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency> is
one of the most reliable techniques for making large performance improvements regardless of language or compiler.

A classic example is L<Boyer-Moore|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm>.
To match a small string in a large string, one obvious way to do it is to compare the first character of the
two strings and then, if they match, compare the second characters, or, if they don't match, compare the first
character of the small string with the second character in the large string, and so on. In contrast, the
Boyer-Moore algorithm starts by comparing the *last* character of the small string with the corresponding
character in the large string. For most strings the Boyer-Moore algorithm is close to N times faster where
N is the length of the small string.

=head2 Changing sequential/blocking code to parallel/non-blocking

This is a very important class of algorithmic improvement.

See the slides for
L<Parallelism, Concurrency, and Asynchrony in Perl 6|http://jnthn.net/papers/2015-yapcasia-concurrency.pdf#page=17>
and/or L<the matching video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpqnNCx7wVY&list=PLRuESFRW2Fa77XObvk7-BYVFwobZHdXdK&index=8>.

=head2 Using native types

You may be able to make some code run faster and/or use less ram by adding native types to your code:

XXX Start of section to be written

    code/discussion that demonstrates use of native types to improve performance
                                      use of native types that worsens performance
                                      use of native types that breaks code

XXX End of section to be written
    
=head2 Using existing high performance code

Is there an existing high (enough) performance implementation of what you're trying to speed up / slim down?

There are a lot of C libs out there.
L<NativeCall|/language/nativecall> makes it easy to create wrappers for C libs (there's experimental
support for C++ libs too) such as L<Gumbo|https://github.com/Skarsnik/perl6-gumbo>.
(Data marshalling and call handling is somewhat poorly optimized at the time of writing this but for many
applications that won't matter.)

Perl 5's compiler can be treated as a C lib. Mix in Perl 6 types, the L<MOP|/language/mop>, and some hairy
programming that someone else has done for you, and the upshot is that you can conveniently
L<use Perl 5 modules in Perl 6|http://stackoverflow.com/a/27206428/1077672>.

More generally, Perl 6 is designed to be able to smoothly interop with any other language and there are a number
of L<modules aimed at providing convenient use of libs from other langs|http://modules.perl6.org/#q=inline>.

=head2 Speeding up Rakudo itself

The focus to date (Feb 2016) regarding the compiler has been correctness, not speed, but that's expected to
change somewhat this year and beyond. You can talk to compiler devs on the freenode IRC channels #perl6 and
#moarvm about what to expect. Or you can contribute yourself:

=item Rakudo is largely written in Perl 6. So if you can write Perl 6, then you can hack on the compiler,
including optimizing any of the large body of existing high-level code that impacts the speed of your code
(and everyone else's).

=item Most of the rest of the compiler is written in a small language called
L<NQP|https://github.com/perl6/nqp> that's basically a subset of Perl 6.
If you can write Perl 6 you can fairly easily learn to use and improve the mid-level NQP code too,
at least from a pure language point of view. 
Start with L<NQP and internals course|http://edumentab.github.io/rakudo-and-nqp-internals-course/>.

=item Finally, if low-level C hacking is your idea of fun, checkout L<MoarVM|http://moarvm.org>.

=head2 Still need more?

There are many other things to consider:
improving L<data alignment|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment>,
L<data granularity|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity#Data_granularity>,
L<data compression|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression>, and
L<locality of reference|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference> to name a few.
If you think some topic needs more coverage on this page please submit a PR or tell someone your idea.
Thanks. :)

B<Tried everything? Frustrated?> Please consider talking to someone in the community about your use-case
before giving up or concluding the answer to
L<Is Perl 6 fast enough for me?|http://doc.perl6.org/language/faq#Is_Perl_6_fast_enough_for_me?> is "No".
